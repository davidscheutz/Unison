# Unison

Built for Swift developers, Unison separates the model, view, and controller components of the system, and enforces strict rules for updating the system state. This promotes reliable, bug-free code, and makes it easy to reason about the behavior of the system.

### Benefits of using Unison

- **Simplicity**: Unison provides a simple, concise API for defining reactive systems. The framework is designed to be easy to use and understand, even for developers who are new to reactive programming.
- **Clear responsibilites & separation**: Unison provides guidelines
- **Testabilty**: The separation of the pure and impure code makes it easy to write unit tests for each component of the system.
- **Thread-safe**: Unison is designed to work well in a concurrent environment, where multiple threads or processes may be updating the app state simultaneously. The framework provides built-in mechanisms for handling concurrency and preventing race conditions.
- **Preview-abilty**: Unlock the power of SwiftUI's previews and render all the different states of your screen.
- **Performance**: Unison is designed to be efficient and performant, to ensure that even large, complex systems are fast and responsive.
